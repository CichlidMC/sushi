/**
 * This package contains the requirement system, which is intended to
 * be used to provide validation for code adjacent to transformations.
 * <p>
 * For example, consider an injection that injects a call to {@code com.example.MyHooks.onDoThing()}.
 * For that injection to function, that method must obviously exist and have a matching signature.
 * However, Sushi cannot verify this as soon as the transformation is applied, since it may be applied ahead-of-time.
 * <p>
 * Instead, the requirements system collects this information so it can be put to use later,
 * potentially by a Gradle plugin, compiler plugin, IDE plugin, or similar.
